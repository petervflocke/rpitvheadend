###Introduction:

This RPI TVHeadEnd Server is a platform based on Raspberry PI hardware, which creates a headless DVB-S2 Tuner and streams the video to any network client. This platform supports conditional access via “oscam” server.


###Hidden Agenda - local and remote control examples
You can either recreate this to have similar platform or rip out three  “goodies” for your own Raspberry Pi projects. Respective two github repositories provide you:
Python **Rotary Encoder Knob** class based on interrupts (to preserve processor's power and save energy). Example of **simple pygame interface** using above rotary class encoder and cheap  SainSmart 1.8" TFT LCD display. All this together gives you a lean system with as little as possible components and GPIO lines to leverage your projects with powerful user control. 

Local control is good, remote control via mobile, tablet or computer is even better. There are plenty of projects connecting processes on RPI with mobile apps. Here you will be given a plain piece of python code to create an interactive HTML5 page you can open in any modern browser and control your RPI remotely.
